# Shiny Application to Explore Sampling Distributions and The Central Limit Theorem

## Introduction

This application lets users upload a data set to use as a population from which samples can be drawn, or simulate a dataset from a wide variety of distribution. 

The population distribution of the variable of interest (user's choice) is shown, and multiple samples created. For each sample, the value of a chosen test statistic is calculated. The distribution of this is then displayed as a histogram. This histogram can be build one sample at a time in an animated fashion, or the user can choose to skip ahead. 

## Planned

[] New tab with exercise like exploration of the Central Limit Theorem.
